# DisasterRelief
This is a project using R, a problem we also called a blue-tarp problem.

We need to locate displaced people living in makeshift shelters following the destruction of the earchquake in Haiti in 2010.
Here, we use different models to determine the location of blue-tarps in a series of images taken by aircrafts. 
The goal is to locate the areas covered by blue-tarp, likely spots for human inhabitation.
